# Introduction
Welcome to the Suicide Statistics Explorer, a dynamic and insightful Streamlit application designed to unravel the intricate facets of suicide trends in India from 2001 to 2012. Our app features four distinct tabs, each offering a unique lens into the comprehensive dataset.

In **Tab1 - State-Wide Suicide Count By Age_Group**, users can seamlessly navigate through state-wide and age-group-based counts, gaining profound insights into the evolving landscape of suicides over the specified period. Select specific states and age groups to uncover patterns, trends, and the nuanced dynamics that shape these statistics.

**Tab2 - Type of Suicide By State** introduces an innovative Word Cloud visualization technique, transforming raw data into a visually striking representation of suicide types. Dive into the frequency of suicide types for a chosen state, with word sizes dynamically reflecting their prevalence, offering an engaging and accessible exploration of this critical information.

**Tab3 - Suicide Statistics Analysis by Gender** delves into the gender-specific nuances of suicide counts. Users can analyze the distribution of suicides based on age group and state, facilitating a deeper understanding of the impact on different demographic segments and uncovering potential correlations.

Finally, in **Tab4 - Suicides Statistics Analysis by Year and Age_group**, users can explore the data through an intuitive Heatmap. This feature allows for the seamless investigation of suicide patterns across different years and age groups, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the temporal and demographic aspects of the dataset.

Join us on this journey to shed light on the multifaceted landscape of suicide statistics, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing these trends and fostering a data-driven dialogue for positive change. Explore the tabs, interact with the visualizations, and discover the stories hidden within the numbers. Your exploration begins here.

# Data Source

The Suicides of India data has been taken from the Kaggle Website.

The link for the Kaggle dataset is:

I performed Data cleaning in Excell by removing some suicide types which are not relevent.

# Future Work
In future iterations, I plan to extend our temporal analysis beyond 2012, offering a more current snapshot of suicide trends.
